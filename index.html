    <h2><u>Projects</u></h2>
    <h3>We're currently working on 2 projects, Research and LOST_FILE:\</h3>
    <p>The first project is called Research, a story game where there is 2 paths good and bad doctor. You cure diseases or make new species like a new animal or
        even build your own business, but at one point you will have to choose a path, good or bad doctor. When you cure a disease you get good honor and bad honor
        when you make a disease and when you cure a disease you get a fragment of it. The second project is a horror game called LOST_FILE:\, and in it you get trapped
        in an unfinished game and you have to finish an NPC for him to help you escape. But he wont be as you expect.
